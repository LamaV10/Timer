# Timer

This is a really simple timer written in python. After a given time it will play your music. 

# Usage

In order do that you have to create a folder named "Music" inside "Source/" and then put your music in there.
After that you can execute the musicSetup.sh script, which will bring you to the module responsible for the music (music.py).
Neovim, Vim, Nano and Vscode/ium are supported in this script.
Let me know which editors you want to be added!

# Linux 

If you are on Linux, you can also copy the timer.sh file into the /bin directory (you can also rename it to timer). 
Then you have to modify the path in the timer file to cd to your "timer" folder location. 
Now you should be able to directly type the command "timer" (or "timer.sh" if you have not renamed it) into your terminal.
(This is just experimental!)

# Requirements

- Python with the dependencies from requirements.txt installed
- Bash to execute the scripts
